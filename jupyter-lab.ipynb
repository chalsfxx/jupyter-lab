    "### Arithmetic Expression Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are mathematical calculations that involve numbers, operators, and sometimes variables. They can be simple or complex, and are commonly used in various programming languages and mathematical contexts. Here are a few examples of arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: The `+` operator is used for addition. For example, `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subtraction: The `-` operator is used for subtraction. For example, `5 - 2` evaluates to `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multiplication: The `*` operator is used for multiplication. For example, `3 * 4` evaluates to `12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Division: The `/` operator is used for division. For example, `10 / 2` evaluates to `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Exponentiation: The `**` operator is used for exponentiation. For example, `2 ** 3` evaluates to `8` (2 raised to the power of 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Modulo: The `%` operator calculates the remainder of a division. For example, `10 % 3` evaluates to `1` (remainder of dividing 10 by 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are basic arithmetic operations, but expressions can also involve parentheses `()` to control the order of operations. For example, `(2 + 3) * 4` evaluates to `20` (adding 2 and 3 first, then multiplying the result by 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions play a crucial role in performing calculations and solving mathematical problems. They are also fundamental in programming for implementing algorithms and manipulating data.\n"
